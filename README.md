## MGARD

MGARD (MultiGrid Adaptive Reduction of Data) is a technique for multilevel lossy compression of scientific data based on the theory of multigrid methods.
This is an experimental C++ API for integration with existing software, use at your own risk!

The double precision API consists of a header file: `mgard_api.h`, for single precision the header file is `mgard_api_float.h`.

Users need only include this header file, and link against the static
library `libmgard.a`.

This header file provides prototypes for the following overloaded functions:

```
unsigned char *mgard_compress(int itype_flag, double/float *data, int
*out_size, int n1, int n2, int n3, double/float tol, [qoi, s = infinity])
```

It returns a pointer to an `unsigned char` array of compressed data.
The arguments are:

     itype_flag: Data type, 0 for float, 1 for double
     data : Pointer to the input buffer (interpreted as 2D matrix) to compress with MGARD,
            this buffer will be destroyed!
     out_size: size of input data, returns compressed size on exit
     n1: Size of first dimension
     n2: Size of second dimension
     n3: Size of third dimension
     tol: Upper bound for desired tolerance
     qoi: Function pointer to the quantity of interest
     s: The norm in which the error will be preserved, L-\infty assumed if not present in the function call.

The next overload is

```
void *mgard_decompress(int itype_flag, unsigned char *data,
int data_len, int n1, int n2, int n3,[s = infinity])
```

This returns a void pointer to an array of decompressed data, which must be cast to `float` or `double`.
The arguments are:

     itype_flag: Data type, 0 for float, 1 for double
     data : Pointer to the input buffer (interpreted as 2D matrix) to decompress with MGARD,
            this buffer will be destroyed!
     data_len: size of input data in bytes
     n1: Size of first dimension
     n2: Size of second dimension
     n3: Size of third dimension
     s: The norm in which the error will be preserved, L-\infty assumed if not present in the function call.

The `qoi` function pointer must compute the quantity of interest, *Q(v)*.
Its only use is to estimate the Besov *s*-norm of the operator *Q*; if this can be derived independently, then there is no need to provide it.
