# MGARD [![Build Status][travis status]][travis]

MGARD (MultiGrid Adaptive Reduction of Data) is a technique for multilevel lossy compression of scientific data based on the theory of multigrid methods.
This is an experimental C++ implementation for integration with existing software; use at your own risk!
We encourage you to [make a GitHub issue][issue form] if you run into any problems using MGARD, have any questions or suggestions, etc.

## Use MGARD

The API consists of a header file `include/mgard_api.h` providing declarations for function templates `mgard::compress` and `mgard::decompress`.
See [the header][api] for documentation of these templates.

1. Build MGARD by either running `make lib/libmgard.a` to generate a static library, or `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<location to install MGARD> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE  -DZSTD_ROOT=<optional, location to ZSTD installation> ..`.
2. Include `mgard_api.h` in any source files making use of the API.
3. Link against `libmgard.a` when creating your executable.

### GPU acceleration
See [here][gpu] for detailed instructions of using MGARD with GPU acceleration.

## Caveats

In addition to `mgard::compress` and `mgard::decompress`, the API also provides declarations for deprecated functions `mgard_compress` and `mgard_decompress`.
When decompressing with `mgard_decompress`, a smoothness parameter `s` must be specified.
*The `s` value you use to decompress must be the same as the `s` value you used to compress.*
You cannot agnostically decompress the compressed representation, and the value of `s` is not stored in the compressed stream, so if you forget the value of `s` you used when compressing your data, your data is gone.
In addition, there is no way to detect if an inconsistent value of `s` has been passed, so the code returns corrupted data silently.
You can avoid this problem by using `mgard::compress` and `mgard::decompress` instead.
