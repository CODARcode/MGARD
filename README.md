# MGARD [![build status][push workflow badge]][push workflow] [![format status][format workflow badge]][format workflow]

MGARD (MultiGrid Adaptive Reduction of Data) is a technique for multilevel lossy compression of scientific data based on the theory of multigrid methods.
This is an experimental C++ implementation for integration with existing software; use at your own risk!
We encourage you to [make a GitHub issue][issue form] if you run into any problems using MGARD, have any questions or suggestions, etc.

## Building and Installing

To build and install MGARD, run the following from the root of the repository.
You will need [CMake][cmake].

```console
$ cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<location to install MGARD>
$ cmake --build build
$ cmake --install build
```

[cmake]: https://cmake.org/

### GPU Acceleration

Detailed instructions for using MGARD with GPU acceleration can be found [here][gpu instructions].

[gpu instructions]: doc/MGARD-GPU.md

## Including and Linking

The API consists of a header file `compress.hpp` providing declarations for function templates `mgard::compress` and `mgard::decompress`.
See [the header][api] for documentation of these templates.

To use MGARD in your project, you will need to tell your compiler where to find the MGARD headers (by default, `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/mgard/`) and library (by default, `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/`).
If you're using CMake, you can call `find_package(mgard)` and add a dependency to the `mgard::mgard` imported target.
See [the examples directory][examples] for a basic example.

[api]: include/compress.hpp
[examples]: examples/README.md

## Command Line Interface

Assuming the dependencies are met, an executable called `mgard` will be built and installed.
You can get help with the executable by running the following commands.

```console
$ mgard --help
$ man mgard
```
