MGARD (MultiGrid Adaptive Reduction of Data) is a recently developed
technique for multilevel lossy compression and reduction of scientific
data. The technique is based on the theory of multigrid methods. This
archive presents a preliminary C++ language API for integration with
existing software, use at your own risk!

The API consists of a header file: include/mgard_api.h

Users need only include this header file, and link against the static
library libmgard.a.

This header file provides prototypes for the following overloaded functions:

unsigned char *mgard_compress(int itype_flag, void *data, int
*out_size, int nrow, int ncol, int nfib, void* tol, [qoi, s =0]) : Returns pointer to unsigned char array of compressed data
                      
     itype_flag: Data type, 0 for float, 1 for double
     data : Pointer to the input buffer (interpreted as 2D matrix) to compress with MGARD,
            this buffer will be destroyed!
     out_size: size of input data, returns compressed size on exit
     nrow: Number of rows of matrix
     ncol: Number of columns of matrix
     nfib: Number of "fiber" of matrix, should have been tubes though!
     tol: Upper bound for desired tolerance
     qoi: Function pointer to the quantity of interest
     s: The norm in which the error will be preserved, L-\infty assumed if not present in the function call.

void *mgard_decompress(int itype_flag, unsigned char *data,
int data_len, int nrow, int ncol, int nfib,[s=0]): Returns float/double pointer to array of decompressed data 

     itype_flag: Data type, 0 for float, 1 for double
     data : Pointer to the input buffer (interpreted as 2D matrix) to decompress with MGARD,
            this buffer will be destroyed!
     data_len: size of input data in bytes
     nrow: Number of rows of matrix
     ncol: Number of columns of matrix
     nfib: Number of "fiber" of matrix, should have been tubes though!
     s: The norm in which the error will be preserved, L-\infty assumed if not present in the function call.
